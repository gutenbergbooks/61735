<h2 class="hidden">How the Frog Boys Surprised the Fox</h2>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i006.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>1. One day, as Uncle Wiggily was hopping through the woods, he
looked toward a pond and saw Bully and Bawly No Tail, the frog boys,
jumping from the end of the spring board. “Ah, that reminds me of the
time I was young!” thought the bunny gentleman. “As long as Nurse
Jane isn’t here I’m going to dive in and swim.” Into the swimming
hole splashed Bully and Bawly as the bunny rabbit took off his coat.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i007.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>2. “Oh, hurray! Here’s Uncle Wiggily!” croaked Bully. “Come on
in, the water’s fine!” rumbled Bawly. “Thanks, I’ll try, though I am
not a very good swimmer or diver,” answered Mr. Longears. He stood
on the end of the teeter-tauter spring board. “One, two, three!”
counted Bully. “Jump in!” Uncle Wiggily twinkled his pink nose,
and, hoping he would not get too much water up it, in he jumped!</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i008.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>3. Uncle Wiggily did not think he was going to jump so hard, but he
did and his head was stuck in the mud of the pond bottom. “Blubble!
Ubble! Blub!” cried the poor rabbit gentleman. “Quick! We must
pull him out! Get hold of his other leg!” croaked Bully. The two
froggie boys, on the end of the spring board, pulled as hard as they
could. “If we get him out we’ll put him on a raft,” croaked Bully.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i009.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>4. “I guess you had better not try any more swimming or diving,”
said the frog boys to Uncle Wiggily, after they had pulled him out of
the mud where he stuck upside down. “I think you are right,” agreed
the rabbit gentleman. So Bully and Bawly made a raft and Uncle
Wiggily rested easily on it while the froggie boys poled it about
the pond. And then—the Fuzzy Fox crept softly to the pond’s edge.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i010.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>5. “Well, boys, I think you’ve given me a long enough ride,” said
Uncle Wiggily after a while. “Just push the raft toward shore and
I’ll dress.” So the raft was shoved toward shore. The Froggie boys
began leaping in from the spring board and the Fuzzy Fox went down
to the water’s edge to wait for the rabbit to come ashore. “And then
how I will nibble his ears!” thought the Fox, smacking his lips.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i011.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>6. “Oh, my goodness! What is this?” cried Uncle Wiggily as the
Fox pulled him from the raft when shore was reached. “Ears is the
answer, Uncle Wiggily!” growled the Fox. “I’m going to take you off
to my den in the woods and nibble your ears.” Not waiting to let the
bunny dress himself, the Fox led the way. But Bully and Bawly are
going to play a trick. “We’ll sling this stone at the Fox,” they said.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i012.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>7. On shore the Fox tied a piece of grape vine rope around poor
Uncle Wiggily’s neck and dragged the bunny along through the woods.
“Now it will be easy to whack the Fox with the stone and not hit
Uncle Wiggily,” croaked Bully as he and his brother pulled down on
the spring board which was to sling the stone through the air as if from
a gun. “Oh, how good some ear nibbles will taste!” smacked the Fox.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i013.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>8. “Is everything all ready?” asked Bully as he and his brother
pulled the spring board down as far as it would come. “All ready!”
croaked Bawly. “Then let her go!” cried Bully, and they let go the
spring board. Up and away sailed the big rock, straight toward the bad
Fox who was leading Uncle Wiggily to the den. “Won’t you please let
me go?” begged the poor bunny. “No!” snarled the Fox and then—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i014.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p>9. All of a sudden the stone struck the Fox in his soft and tender
ribs. “Um!” grunted the Fox. “What is going to happen?” But that
was all he could ask, for down he fell and the stone fell on top of him
and he couldn’t get up to nibble Uncle Wiggily’s ears. “You were
very smart, froggie boys, to think of that trick!” laughed the bunny
as the three friends hopped away. And the Fox cried: “Wow!”</p>

<h2 class="hidden">Uncle Wiggily Distributes Thanksgiving Cakes</h2>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i016.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>1. “Well, Nurse Jane, I’m going!” cried Uncle Wiggily as he started
out from his hollow stump bungalow one day, carrying a basket full of
frosted cakes. “Where are you going?” asked the muskrat lady
housekeeper. “I’m going to call on my friends,” answered the bunny. “And
to every one who is thankful at this Thanksgiving season, I’m going to
give a cake.” Nurse Jane told him to watch out for the Fox and Wolf.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i017.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>2. Uncle Wiggily hopped along with his basket of Thanksgiving
cakes until he came to the home of Mr. Twistytail, the pig gentleman.
“What is the matter?” asked the bunny. “Oh, I’m a very sick pig,”
was the answer. “Then I suppose you have nothing to be thankful
for?” asked the bunny. “Oh, yes, I’m glad all my legs aren’t tied up,”
grunted Mr. Twistytail. “You get a cake!” laughed Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i018.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>3. Leaving thankful Mr. Twistytail, Uncle Wiggily saw Uncle Butter
the goat. Uncle Butter was running toward a fence on which was
posted the picture of another goat. “Ah,” said Uncle Wiggily, “my
friend is going to have a little morning exercise. He is going to see
how strong his horns are. He must be thankful that he is so strong.
I’ll give him a cake after he bangs the picture goat. He can’t hurt him.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i019.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>4. All of a sudden Uncle Butter banged himself against the fence.
But the boards were thin and Uncle Butter’s head went all the way
through and stuck out on the other side. “Dear me!” cried Uncle
Wiggily, “I suppose you have nothing to be thankful for now!” Uncle
Butter bleated and said he was glad he didn’t have two heads to get
stuck in the fence. “Ha! Ha!” laughed the bunny. “You get a cake!”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i020.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>5. Uncle Wiggily helped Uncle Butter pull his head out of the fence,
and then the goat gentleman took his Thanksgiving cake home. Uncle
Wiggily hopped on a little farther until he met Police Dog Percival.
“Why do you look so bad, Percival?” asked the bunny. “I’m afraid
you are not thankful. You can’t have a cake.” Percival swung his
club. “No, I’m not thankful. But I smell a Fox. Wait a moment!”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i021.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>6. All of a sudden Police Dog Percival ran down the path and caught
the Fuzzy Fox, who was sneaking up to get Uncle Wiggily. “I arrest
you!” barked Percival. “Wow! Wow! Let me go!” howled the Fox. “No, no!” barked
Percival. “Now I have something to be thankful for! I’ve made an arrest.
That’s why I wasn’t thankful before.” Uncle Wiggily gave Percival a Thanksgiving
cake from his basket.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i022.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>7. After Percival took the Fox to jail, Uncle Wiggily hopped on
with his cake basket. “I wonder whom I shall next meet to give a
Thanksgiving cake?” murmured the bunny. “I’m going to be thankful
in a moment!” howled a harsh voice, and out popped the Woozie
Wolf. “I’ll catch you and nibble your ears—then I’ll be thankful!”
growled the Wolf. Uncle Wiggily ran as fast as he could.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i023.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>8. Uncle Wiggily hopped as he had never hopped before, but the
Wolf could run the faster, and soon the bad animal caught the bunny.
“Ha! Ha!” laughed the Wolf, as he held the bunny by one paw, “you
talk about Thanksgiving! What have you to be thankful for? You
laughed when Percival arrested my friend the Fox! Now it’s my turn
to laugh.” Uncle Wiggily said he had one thing to be thankful for.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i024.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>9. “Ho! Ho! What have you to be thankful for?” sneered the
Wolf. “I have caught you!” and he shook the bunny. “I’m thankful
that the Fox isn’t here,” said Uncle Wiggily. Then slyly he raised the
basket and shoved it over the Wolf’s head. “I am also thankful that I
can put your head in my basket and run away!” laughed the bunny.
“That’s the second part of my Thanksgiving. Now I’m going home!”</p>

THE RABBIT MADE A KITE SO LARGE IT<br />

</div>

<div class='story chapter'>

<h2 class="hidden">The Bunny Rabbit Gentleman Makes A Kite</h2>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i026.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>1. Once upon a time, when it was almost summer, Uncle Wiggily
went out for a walk. He saw some of the animal boys flying their kite.
“Why don’t you make a bigger kite, and one without a tail?” asked the
bunny gentleman. “You can’t make kites any bigger than this,” said
Jackie Bow Wow. “And if you didn’t have a tail they wouldn’t go up,”
added Sammie the rabbit. “Ha! I’ll show you!” said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i027.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>2. “I’ll show those animal boys that I can make a big kite, and one
without a tail,” said Uncle Wiggily, twinkling his pink nose. So he
bought some sticks, paper and string, and soon he had put together a
kite larger than himself. “Uncle Wiggily, what in the world are you
doing?” asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, as she saw the rabbit gentleman
looking at his work. “I know something terrible will happen!”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i028.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>3. “Nonsense, Nurse Jane!” laughed Uncle Wiggily. “Nothing terrible
will happen! I’ll just show the boys how to fly a big kite, that’s
all.” So the rabbit gentleman put up the big kite without a tail. He
twisted the string around his waist, so it would not pull away, and then
came such a big puff of wind that it took the kite, Uncle Wiggily
and all up into the air. “There, I told you so!” cried Nurse Jane.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i029.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>4. At first Uncle Wiggily was so surprised at being carried off by the
kite, he didn’t know what to do. Then he tried to loosen the cord
from around his waist, but it was tied in a hard knot. Straight toward
Grandpa Goosey’s house the kite took Uncle Wiggily. “Bang!” the
bunny’s paws knocked off the chimney. “Hi there!” cried Grandpa
Goosey. “Please excuse me! I couldn’t help it!” shouted the bunny.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i030.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>5. Sailing on, after knocking off Grandpa Goosey’s chimney, Uncle
Wiggily was carried higher and higher by the big kite he had made.
“I guess Nurse Jane was right,” he said to himself. “Something
terrible is going to happen!” Just then the bunny felt a tug at the loose
end of the kite string. He looked down. “Oh, you’re taking me
away!” bleated Aunt Lettie. “Worse and worse!” said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i031.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>6. The wind blew harder and sailed the kite along, taking Uncle
Wiggily and Aunt Lettie with it. “Uncle Wiggily, what does this
mean?” bleated the goat lady. “I wish I knew,” sighed the bunny.
Just then the Fox and Wolf, down on the ground, saw the strange
sight. “Come along!” snarled the Fox to the Wolf. “That string will
break in a little while. They’ll fall and we can nibble their ears!”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i032.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>7. All of a sudden Uncle Wiggily and Aunt Lettie were dragged into
a tree by the kite string. Luckily there were some soft leaves on the
tree and the bunny gentleman and goat lady did not get much hurt.
But the kite cord pulled off the rabbit’s coat and Aunt Lettie’s bonnet
and away they sailed. “Well, we’re safe now, Aunt Lettie,” said
Mr. Longears. “But suppose the Fox and Wolf come?” she asked.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i033.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>8. However, the Fox and Wolf did not come to the tree where Uncle
Wiggily and Aunt Lettie were pulled loose from the kite cord. “Please
let me help you down,” said Uncle Wiggily politely, and he assisted
Aunt Lettie from the tree. “Oh, look!” suddenly cried the goat lady.
“The Fox and Wolf are chasing the kite. They see your coat and my
bonnet and think we’re still on the string.” And that’s what happened.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i034.jpg" class="spix" alt="" />
</div>

<p class='n'>9. “Come on! Come on!” snarled the Fox to the Wolf. “That string
will break soon. Uncle Wiggily and Aunt Lettie will fall and then we
can nibble their ears.” On ran the Fox and Wolf, but, all of a sudden,
the end of the kite cord tangled around them, and up in the air they
went. “Ha! Ha! Look at them!” laughed Uncle Wiggily as he and
Aunt Lettie danced. “Woofie! Wuffie! Wow!” howled the bad chaps!</p>
